* galba.aa.xz - proteins from GALBA predictions
* galba.gtf.xz - GTF style annoations from GALBA

* [softmasked genome FASTA](https://asg_hubs.cog.sanger.ac.uk/peEutLong1/peEutLong1.fa.masked)
* [tarball of RepeatModeller output](https://asg_hubs.cog.sanger.ac.uk/peEutLong1/peEutLong1.tar.xz)

# Notes
* RepeatModeller died on the LTR analysis, so they were not separatedly masked.
* will try some alternate ways to mask the LTRs, as they artificially inflate the gene number
* the euglenozoa proteins were used
